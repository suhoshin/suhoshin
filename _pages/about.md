I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, working with [Prof. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/).
I'm broadly interested in the intersection of microeconomics, theoretical computer science and learning theory.
This includes algorithmic mechanism design/game theory, information design, social learning/choice, and their interface with approximate/randomized/online algorithm, computational complexity, and multi-armed bandits.
