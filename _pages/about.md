I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, working with Prof. MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi.
I'm broadly interested in the intersection of microeconomics, theoretical computer science and learning theory.
This includes algorithmic game theory/mechanism design, information design, social learning/choice, and their interface with approximate/randomized/online algorithm, computational complexity, and multi-armed bandits.
